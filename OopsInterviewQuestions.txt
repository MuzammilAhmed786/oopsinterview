1. what is the default access modifier for a method
private

2. what is the usage of a private method

3. can you call a static method with an instance
no, it gives compile error. you should call it with type

4. Can static methods access non static properties
No

5. what will be the output after first printone() and second printone()

using System;

namespace jfk
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            first f = new first();
            Console.WriteLine(first.hellothere(2));
            first.printone();

            first ff = new first();
            first.printone();
        }
    }

    class first 
    {
        public static int one = 1;
        public static string hellothere(int p)
        {
            one = p;
            
            return "Hello there" + p;
        }

        public static void printone()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(one);
        }
    }
}

Both will have the same value

6. how many instances of a static class can you create 
you cannot create instance of a staic class


7. can you declare a readonly variable in a static class
no, because the value for a readonly variable needs to be set in a constructor and a static class cannot have a constructor

8. Difference between readonly and const
a value needs to be assigned to const when you create it

9.
